# PyChladni

PyChladni is a Python library for generating physically accurate Chladni patterns - the geometric patterns that emerge when plates vibrate at specific frequencies. The library implements Ritz's method with symmetry breaking, providing accurate simulations of both idealized and real-world plate behavior.

## Overview

Chladni patterns form when sand or fine particles on a vibrating plate move to the nodal lines (points of zero displacement). While simple in concept, these patterns reveal complex physics:

- Each pattern emerges from "eigenmodes" - natural resonances determined by two integers and the plate's properties
- The patterns are scale-invariant - they look identical regardless of plate size, only the frequencies change
- Small asymmetries can drive significant pattern changes through mode competition
- Multiple frequencies create complex superpositions of patterns

The library supports:
- Single and multi-frequency pattern generation
- Audio-driven pattern generation
- Frequency sweeps
- Symmetry breaking effects
- Vector field visualization

## Installation

```bash
pip install pychladni
```

### System Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- FFmpeg (required for video generation)

## Quick Start

### Generate a Simple Pattern

```python
from pychladni import ChladniSymmetryBreaking

# Initialize with symmetry breaking
chladni = ChladniSymmetryBreaking(size=100, delta=0.022)

# Compute and visualize a mode
mode, U, V, L = chladni.compute_mode(33.2, max_modes=15)
chladni.plot_field(U, V, plot_type='stream')
```

### Audio-Driven Patterns

```python
from pychladni import AudioChladni

# Initialize
chladni = AudioChladni()

# Generate visualization from audio
patterns = chladni.generate_frame_patterns(
    audio_file="example.mp3",
    start_time=0,
    end_time=30,
    fps=30.0,
    output_dir="output_frames",
    save_video=True
)
```

## Examples

The `examples` folder contains several demonstration scripts:

- `simple_example.py`: Basic pattern generation and mode visualization
- `multi_frequency.py`: Complex patterns from frequency combinations
- `chladni_sweep.py`: Frequency sweep animations
- `audio_driven.py`: Audio-driven pattern generation

## Technical Background

### Ritz Method
The simulation uses Ritz's method to solve the plate equation, approximating the solution as a series of basis functions. This provides an efficient way to compute eigenmodes and their interactions.

### Symmetry Breaking
Real plates exhibit small asymmetries that break the perfect symmetry assumed in idealized models. When modes have similar energies, they compete through these asymmetries, leading to pattern instabilities at certain frequencies. Our implementation includes these effects based on recent research.
